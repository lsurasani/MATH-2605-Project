README

Language used - MATLAB.

The Project has 3 driver functions. One for each Question.
They should be run on the MATLAB console within the directory with all the code.

Question 1.
The data retrieved for the written answers can be found in the by running solvePascal(). The data requested for Part 1 will be displayed, including the x solution vector, error from Givens Rotation, error from Householder's Rotation, error from LU Factorization, and the error when solving for Px = b.
The written part of the project is in the file labeled Question1.

Question 2.
The data retrieved for the written answers can be found in the by running iter_display(). The data requested for Part 3 will be displayed, including the result of running the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi iterations, the number of iterations required for both, the error from both methods, and the ratio of Jacobi iterations to Gauss-Seidel iterations.
The written part of the project is in the file labeled Question2.

Question 3.
The data retrieved for the written answers can be found in the by running power_display(). 
The written part of the project is in the file labeled Question3.
